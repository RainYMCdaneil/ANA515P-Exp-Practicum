The project is based on Project 1. NYC GT data.  
This data comes from NYC parents reporting their kidsâ€™ scores on the gifted and talented exam, as well as school preferences.
 G&T Results 2017-18 (Responses) is file 1,  G&T Results 2018-19 (Responses) is file 2. 

I have combined the two files into one called combined_file.  In this assignment, I would like to show show the overall score under different districts.
